Stpes 1:
 - manually peform and check working or not

Step 2:
 - if working download modules for command used in manual steps 
 - ansibile.builtin.apt
      -  it is a module of apt (as we use "apt" in manual process)

 step 3:
 - write Host file
    - here we have to give node IP address
    
 - write play book 
    - here we have to write what we want to create in nodes

    "-name" : give same name of playbook (play 1)
    "become" : rootuser/sudo permission (yes or no)
        - if all command in manual steps use "sudo" then "become": "yes"
    "hosts" : all 
        - where to run the playbook
    "tasks" : in which we write multiple task
            "-name" : "any-name"
                -  name of task 1

            "ansible.builtin.apt" 
                -  module of apt

            "state": present 
                - (means is to be installed)

            "update_cache": "yes / no 
                - "means "sudo apt update", we have to update packge, for update package we use this  

step 4: run play book in ansible control plane

    1. first "check syntax" error
        
        - ansible-playbook --syntax-check -i host all playbook.yaml
        
        - if above command showing nothing means playbook is ok

    2. now "check" it is executing or not
        
        - ansible-playbook --check -i host all playbook.yaml

        - it gives the details (in console)
            - green color representation means --> already present
            - yellow color representation means --> now installing
    
    3. now "execute/run" the playbook
       
        - ansible-playbook -i host all playbook.yaml
       
        - same representation in console as "check" gives
