activity 2: install php on apache server

Solution:

Step 1:
  - first install manually on some linux machine, if it is work than write playbook

Step2:
  - get module for each command used for installation apache and php manaully
    modules:
      - apt --> ansible.builtin.apt
      - file -->  ansible.builtin.file

Step 3: write play book
    

            
            "ansible.builtin.apt" 
                -  module of apt
            
            "ansible.builtin.copy": 
                -  mofule of copy used for copying php.info file from this loction to "/var/www/html/info.php"

            "state": present 
                - (means is to be installed)

            "update_cache": "yes / no 
                - "means "sudo apt update", we have to update packge, for update package we use this  

step 4: run play book in ansible control plane

    1. first "check syntax" error
        
        - ansible-playbook --syntax-check -i host all playbook.yaml
        
        - if above command showing nothing means playbook is ok

    2. now "check" it is executing or not
        
        - ansible-playbook --check -i host all playbook.yaml

        - it gives the details (in console)
            - green color representation means --> already present
            - yellow color representation means --> now installing
    
    3. now "execute/run" the playbook
       
        - ansible-playbook -i host all playbook.yaml
       
        - same representation in console as "check" gives
