Activity 04: Php on apache (both machine) single playbook

manaul installation:

**1. on ubuntu:**

- search on google "installing lamp on ubuntu" use first link
      - lamp --> Linux Apache Mysql php
  - first we have to install apche 
  - and then use apache server, install php on it

Manual steps:
  - first we have to install manually 
  - if it is work then we have to write play book for that

command:
   Refer here : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-22-04

  for apache:
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install apache2
  
  for php: 
    - sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

    - after that we have to create one file with name "php.info" at location "/var/www/html/info.php" and writes inside it 
        - <?php
        phpinfo();
        ?>
    - here we create file php.info and coping into "/var/www/html/info.php"



**2. on Redhat**


Atctivity 3: installing php on apache server (on red hat machine)

Manual process:

 - first we have to install manually on one machine 
 - check it is working or not 
 - if it is working then write playbook

Manual command:

- in ubuntu package manager is "apt" but in Redhat older version is "yum" and now "dnf" is used

1. apache installtion

 - sudo dnf install httpd  
 - sudo systemctl start httpd 
 - sudo systemctl enable httpd 
    * in ubuntu apache server automatically started running
    * but in red hat we have to "enable" and "start" for that above two command is used
    * then only we can access it from IP address

2. php installtion

 - sudo dnf install php php-cli php-common php-gd php-mysqlnd php-pdo 

- after that we have to create one file with name "php.info" at location "/var/www/html/info.php" and writes inside it 
        - <?php
        phpinfo();
        ?>
- here we create file php.info and coping into "/var/www/html/info.php"


**Concept of Fail in ansible:**

  - if we write cript for some operating system and other user execute this script in different os then it should give an error at console or during execution
  - for that we have to write the ine task for that
  - module use for fail is
    - ansible.builtin.fail
