solution:

step01;
    - manual check all command working or not 
    - if working then write playbook

step2:
    - now we have to write one playbook for both machine
    - so we have to use "facts" and "condtional" command that is "when" in ansible


Step3: write all module used for playbook
    - apt:
        - ansible.builtin.apt
    - dng:
        - ansible.builtin.dnf
    - copy:
        - ansible.builtin.copy
    - fail:
        - ansible.builtin.fail
    - service:
        - ansible.builtin.service

step4: execute playbbok

step5: access application
