activity 05: install tomcat aapp server on ubuntu 22.04 using ansible
----------------------------------------------------------------------

manual installation: (detail understanding of all command)

sudo apt update   
    - first update the package

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    - install java 11
    - "java -version" --> check java installed or not

sudo useradd -m -U -d /opt/tomcat -s /bin/false tomcat
    - add user using command "useradd"
    - "-m" used to create a user home directory
    - "-U" used for create a group with same name as user
    - "-d" for home directory <pass directory>
    - "/opt/tomcat" --> makes this directory as a home direcctory for user
    - "-s" for which shell want to use for user <pass shell>
    - "/bin/false" --> we pass this shell, this shell used by user (for this we need -d)
    - "tomcat" --> we create a user of this name

VERSION=10.1.4
    - we download the version = 10.1.14
    - what ever we pass in the version, it will replace in link where {VERSION} is present. this is for, if in future any one want to use latest version just declare version in VERSEIO. that it

wget https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-10/v${VERSION}/bin/apache-tomcat-${VERSION}.tar.gz -P /tmp
    - download this tomcat file and store at some locaton
    - "wget" --> command to download
    - "link" --> tomcat link
    - "-P" --> download file at loaction <pass directory>
    - "/tmp" --> here we download the file (for this we need -P)

sudo tar -xf /tmp/apache-tomcat-${VERSION}.tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat/
    - now extract/untar the file
    - "tar" --> file type
    - "-x" --> for extract
    - "-f" --> for archive file
            - "-xf" --> for untar the archive file
    - "/tmp/apache-tomcat-${VERSION}.tar.gz" --> this is the file to untar
    - "-C" --> where we want to extract <pass directory>
    - "/opt/tomcaat/" --> here we want to extract (for thssi we need "-C")

sudo ln -s /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-${VERSION} /opt/tomcat/latest
    - now we create symlink --> means in futrue we might get multiple version of the tomcat so, the downloaded file converted into latest version
    - "ln" --> for symlink
    - "-s" for where the source file presnet <path>
    - "/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-${VERSION}" --> file
    - "/opt/tomcat/latest" --> destination, here create a file with name "latest"

sudo chown -R tomcat: /opt/tomcat
    - now what ever presnet in the "/opt/tomcat" is owner permission is "root" and group permission is "root"
    - we have to change it to owner permission ="tomcat" and group permission = "tomcat"

sudo sh -c 'chmod +x /opt/tomcat/latest/bin/*.sh'
    - all ".sh" file present in "/opt/tomcat" has only owner --> read write permssion i.e "-wr", group --> re permssion i.e "-r", other --> red permssion i.e "-r"
    - now we change it to "execute permission" i.e "-x"

#####
- after that we need to start the servcie of tomcat
